# Season Creation Onboarding Experience - Product Requirements

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive requirements for creating a seamless season creation onboarding experience that guides users through setting up their personal development seasons. The experience should feel intuitive, engaging, and ensure users create meaningful, actionable seasons they're excited to pursue.

## Product Context

Based on the `SeasonCreationService`, users create seasons with a hierarchical structure:

### Core Business Rules
- Users can only have one active season at a time
- Seasons start in DRAFT status until activated
- Health & Fitness pillar is included by default
- No duplicate areas or metrics within the same pillar/area
- Goals are optional but recommended for measurable progress

## User Journey & Flow
